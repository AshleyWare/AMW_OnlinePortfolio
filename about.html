		<p> Ashley is a 24 year old from New Orleans, Louisiana. She is a proud <a href="http://mcdonogh.la.opc.schoolinsites.com/?PageName=%27AboutTheSchool%27">Roneagle</a> and was valedictorian of her graduation class in 2011. From there she pursued her Chemical Engineering degree from "The Pride of the Swift Growing South", <a href="tuskee.edu">Tuskegee University</a>. Ashley worked as a process engineer for on of the largest private companies in America. But as she often does, she decided she wanted to learn more.</p>
		<p>Ashley has always strives to be a well-rounded individual. She wants to learn as many different things as she can. A "T-shaped" employee of sorts. As she grew professionally in engineering, she realized she could be of much more help to the business and probably to the world if she understood computer programming. Everything around us is changing and Ashley isn't one to get left behind.</p>
		<p>And so it began. Ashley enrolled in the local university to learn more about managing information systems. From there she went to learning Full Stack Development starting with Front-End.</p>
		<p>What will she create? How will she claim her place in this ever-dynamic world of technology? There's only one way to find out...This website.</p>
